    "The minimum is taken to avoid the overestimation of Q-values, an issue that also occurs in these kinds of methods in online RL. In offline RL, as we saw, o.o.d. actions are the ones that typically produce such overestimations. Therefore, clipped-DDQ also introduces control over this issue at the Q-value level, achieving a similar effect to what policy regularization methods aim for with a lower bound on Q-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few technical details**:\n",
    "\n",

    "We allow actions with high Q-values to introduce some uncertainty, helping the algorithm explore regions of lower reward to avoid overestimation effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as running a VAE during training can be computationally expensive, the algorithm introduces a perturbation model $\\xi_\\phi(s, a_i, \\Phi)$, which outputs an adjustment to an action $a$ in the range $[-\\Phi, \\Phi]$. Therefore, eq.7 becomes:\n",

    "Note that if $\\Phi=0$ and $n=1$ the policy will resemble behavioral cloning.\n",
    "On the opposite side if d $\\Phi \\rightarrow a_{max} - a_{min}$ and $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, then the algorithm approaches Q-learning, as the policy begins to greedily maximize the value function over the entire action space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: As it learns how to generate new actions not included in the dataset, it is suitable for small datasets and for unbalanced sets where a few unrepresented actions could be important for the task to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:  Since BCQ generates actions from a VAE, if the dataset used to train it underrepresents some important actions, the VAE may struggle to generate meaningful actions around those states, making the discovery of new or unconventional actions difficult. This is one of the limitations of constrained policy approaches."
